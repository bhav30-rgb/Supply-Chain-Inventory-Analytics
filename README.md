📦 UnoMart Inventory Analytics Case Study
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on inventory analytics for UnoMart, a global e-commerce retailer expanding in India. The objective is to simulate real-world supply chain challenges, analyze stock movements across distribution centers (DCs), and provide data-driven recommendations for efficient inventory management.

🎯 Objectives

Track and analyze SKU-wise inventory movement (opening & closing stock) for 15 days.

Identify high-volume and high-revenue SKUs.

Optimize SKU placement across mother and child distribution centers.

Flag stock-outs, negative stock days, and reorder requirements.

Build interactive Excel dashboards and a summary panel to answer business questions.

❓ Business Questions Addressed

Which SKUs contribute the most to volume and revenue?

How should high-revenue vs high-volume SKUs be allocated between mother DC (Hyderabad) and child DCs (Madras & Coimbatore)?

What is the best way to organize SKU placement in warehouses for operational efficiency?

Which SKUs require reorder alerts to avoid stock-outs and lost sales?

⚙️ Steps Performed

Created a day-wise inventory ledger with opening & closing stock for each SKU.

Performed volume and revenue contribution analysis.

Identified stock-out days and negative stock values.

Designed Excel dashboards with:

KPI Cards (Stock levels, No. of SKUs, Revenue)

SKU-wise Volume Split

Top 10 SKUs by Revenue

Revenue Contribution by Category

Added a Summary Panel with key insights, actions, and methodology.

📊 Key Findings

High-volume SKUs: E01, G01, F01

High-revenue SKU: G01 dominates, requires priority storage at the mother DC.

Stock Issues: G01, G02, G03 had negative stock on multiple days; E07, E09 experienced 0-stock days.

Critical Risk: G01 (top revenue earner) faced negative stock, implying potential lost sales.

✅ Recommendations

Immediate replenishment: G01, G02, G03 (Critical SKUs).

Reorder & monitor: E07, E09.

Operational Fix: Correct negative stock recording through system checks.

Storage Strategy:

High-revenue SKUs → Mother DC

High-volume SKUs → Child DCs

Bulky SKUs → Near warehouse entrances for easy handling

Automation: Use Excel Power Query / SQL / Python to automate inventory ledger creation for scalability.
